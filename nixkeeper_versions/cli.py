"""`python3 -m nixkeeper_versions [DATA_DIR] [--full] [--if-older HOURS]
[--sources-only]`:
bring the digest in
DATA_DIR (default data/) up to date with Repology, and beside it the
newest versions of Typst Universe (typst.py) and the Emacs package
archives (emacs.py), the Stackage LTS nixpkgs follows (stackage.py), CRAN
and the Bioconductor release nixpkgs pins (cran.py), and GitHub-hosted
packages' newest releases and tags (releases.py: weekly where they come
from, daily a seventh of their repositories), and nixpkgs' own facts for
readers without Nix (packages.py: every attribute's pname and version,
and the sources releases.py evaluated): a failed read of those keeps
their last, without stopping the digest. Each run (daily):

1. reads Repology's list of nixpkgs' outdated projects, all of it, as
   nixpkgs-update does: every outdated package's versions, a day old at
   most;
2. reads again, one by one, the projects that were outdated and no longer
   are (updated in nixpkgs, most of them), up to MAX_SINGLE;
3. reads the next ROTATION_PAGES pages of all nixpkgs' projects, going on
   where the last run stopped, so every project (up-to-date ones' other
   repositories, legacy versions, vulnerabilities) is read once a week;
4. finds where the nixpkgs attributes of the projects that disappeared in
   steps 2 and 3 went (Repology renamed or split them), up to MAX_MOVED:
   one request each, by attribute, so a rename is caught the same day
   rather than when the rotation reaches the new name.

With no digest yet, or --full, step 3 reads all of them at once (about 600
pages, an hour). Nothing is written when a step fails: the last digest
stays. --if-older HOURS: only when the last run is older than that (or
there's none), for a run started twice (by the schedule and by hand or a
scheduler outside GitHub) to sweep once. --sources-only: the other sources
only, Repology left alone (no request to it; projects.jsonl.gz as it was),
for trying them without spending Repology's daily allowance."""
