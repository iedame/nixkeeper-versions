"""GitHub releases: the newest release and tag of each nixpkgs package
fetched from a GitHub tag, from GitHub itself, so nixkeeper's verdict on
those packages doesn't depend on Repology (docs/design/github-releases.md
in nixkeeper). About 23,000 packages outside the sets updated in bulk.

Two parts, with nixkeeper's own code (its flake input):

1. Weekly, where each package comes from: its src, evaluated at the
   channel's revision (nixkeeper.sources.nixpkgs.sources, a couple of
   minutes for every package), and from it the tag check nixkeeper's
   update checks would work out (nixkeeper.inferred.github_check): the
   repository, and the tag scheme as a pattern. Needs Nix.
2. Each run, a seventh of the repositories, so each is read weekly, plus
   those never read and those of packages Repology calls outdated: one
   GraphQL query per BATCH repositories, each one's newest tags by commit
   date and its latest release (drafts and pre-releases left out), with
   the workflow's own token (GITHUB_TOKEN).

Kept between runs in releases-state.json.gz (where each package comes
from, what each repository had); written for nixkeeper as
data/releases.json.gz:

    {"format": 1, "fetchedAt": "...", "evaluatedAt": "...", "revision": "...",
     "packages": {"whisky": {"repo": "Whisky-App/Whisky", "version": "2.3.5",
                             "tag": "2.4.0", "release": "2.4.0",
                             "read": "2026-10-08"}, ...},
     "gone": ["owner/repo", ...]}

each package's version in nixpkgs, the newest version among its
repository's tags that match its scheme ("tag"), and its latest release's
when that matches ("release"; what nixkeeper prefers when there is one: a
tag alone may not be released yet), with when the repository was read.
A repository GitHub doesn't know any more is in "gone". A run that fails
keeps the last files."""
